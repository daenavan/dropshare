# DropShare

**Hyper-Local P2P File Sharing with End-to-End Encryption**

DropShare is a secure, private, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer file sharing application that works entirely in your browser. No servers, no sign-ups, just direct connections for fast and secure file transfers.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Peer-to-Peer:** Files are transferred directly between devices without going through a central server.
*   **End-to-End Encrypted:** All files are encrypted using ECDH key exchange with HKDF key derivation and AES-GCM encryption via audited cryptographic libraries (`@noble/*`). See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for details.
*   **QR Code Connections:** Generate QR codes for easy sharing or scan QR codes to connect to other devices.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Works on any modern browser on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **No Installation:** Just open a web page and start sharing.
*   **Multiple File Support:** Share multiple files at once with drag-and-drop support.
*   **Multiple Recipients:** Share files with multiple people simultaneously.
*   **Connection Verification:** Cryptographic challenge-response system ensures secure peer verification.
*   **Dark/Light Theme:** Built-in theme toggle for comfortable use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run DropShare locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/daenax/dropshare.git
    cd dropshare
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as the package manager.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

4.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`). To test P2P functionality:
    - On the first device, click "Start Sharing" to generate a QR code
    - On the second device, click "Start Scanning" to scan the QR code and connect
    - Alternatively, you can copy the connection URL and open it directly on the second device
